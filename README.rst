metadatad
=========

Right now, a set of scripts to tag music files with the top tags from
last.fm. Based on the `Last.fm Plus`_  plugin for Picard_.

At some point, a daemon with web interface that runs on your NAS (or
elsewhere), watching your media directories and keeping meta data for
new and old files up-to-date.

Something like metabrowser, but as a server, and with more automation.
